# BirdID
Identification of bird species using image recognition.

## About
BirdID is an app for the identification of 307 different bird species using image recognition (Convolutional Neural Networks). The app was implemented as part of my bachelor thesis. React Native was used for the app. The neural network was trained with nearly 200,000 Flickr bird photos and deployed using Flask.
